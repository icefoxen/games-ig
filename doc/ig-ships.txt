There are three basic types of weapons.  Direct-fire, missiles, and parasites.
There are several sorta-indistinct subtypes for each.  In direct-fire weapons, there are beams and projectiles, which differ mainly in damage variance, range, and damage dropoff with range.  They all hit instantly, have unlimited ammo, and work basically the same way.

Missiles have missiles and torpedoes.  Torpedoes are big, heavy, tough, slow, inaccurate against moving targets, and do massive amounts of damage.  Missiles are really just missiles.  Both can be shot down by point-defence weapons, but torps could have the ability to take several hits.

Parasites: Roughly akin in size to larger missile launchers, Parasite launchers fire unmanned drones combat vehicles. They are vaguely customizable, and come in a few different roles, and have a set "turn" limit that they can operate before returning to their carrier. Interceptor parasites have extended range fuel supplies and a light beam weapon for knocking out other parasites and missiles. Standard parasites pack a light beam weapon and a few turns of light missiles that don't do terribly huge amounts of damage but get bonuses to penetrate shields. Bombers have more light missiles than standard parasites but don't have the beam weapon.



Direct fire weapons can cause a variety of special effects, depending on the weapons.  These are built-in like MOO1, NOT options like MOO2.

Normal/Heavy	Heavy weapons have longer range and do more damage, but can't be used as point defense
Autofire	Fires multiple shots at a time
Burst		Small chance of doing big damage, critical-hit style
Shield Pen.	Halves shield effectiveness
Concussion	Jostles/moves/spins the target (accuracy penalty for it?)
ER		Greater than average range
Enveloping	Greater than average accuracy
Streaming	Hits all enemies in a stack/fleet.  Chain lightning?

Sword of Fire ***this has Special Device or Beam Weapon written all over it?
Wave-Motion Gun ***these are actually gravity blast cannons Nadesico style

MISSILES: (original no. of MoO 1 missiles, for reference, was 11)
Decoy ***looks like a real missile, mimics other missiles in volley.
Nuclear ***Basic
Stinger ***fusion
Scatterpack V ***splits to five nuclear missiles?
Hellhound **Firebreathing!
Basilisk ***Improved fusion
Archer ***first tier KKM
Scatterpack VII ***splits to seven stinger missiles?
Virus Missile	Computer virus, that is.  Screws their targetting ***moved to weapons
Omega-V  *** advanced fusion
Nova ***first tier antimatter
Scatterpack X ***splits to ten archer missiles?

Quietus *** second tier Antimatter missile
Zeon ***Gravitic


TORPEDOES:
Decoy
Nuclear
Tremor
Plasma-Burst
Disrupter
Magna-Melta
Earth Cracker
Continent Remover
Matter Conversion
Starshatter
Maelstrom


NEAT DEVICES:
STONK 			Stellar Teleportation Of Non-stable Krud
Tractor beam
Repulsor beam ***Ooops. I made Pressor beams into a weapon.		
Intertial Stabilizer / Nullifier	
Subspace Teleporter
Battle Scanner (Generalized scanner techs...)
Reserve Fuel Tanks	
Stasis Field	
Parasite Bays ***required to use Parasite weapons
Autorepair / Adv. Damage Control
Death Ray ***Special Device. Some superweapon similar to MoO1's death ray, but instead is one per ship, Macross-Disintegration-Beam style, and takes a special slot? Perhaps the Sword of Fire could go here? It's huge and prohibitively expensive and takes a weapon slot, too. In fact, if you wanted to make a Macross ship, you'd give it a subspace teleporter, parasite bays, and a Death Ray. And gajillions of particle beams.

Gravwell Generator ***No retreat for you	
Inertial Sap		Slows the enemy down
Minelayer		Drops missiles as mines
Cometdriver		Heheheh.  What do you think?
Flare Inducer		Fwooosh! ***Pulser style? Or like, shoot a star and it makes a flare?
Wormhole Cannon		Teleports enemy
Technology Subverter	Some enemy weapons target their own fleets?
Warp Eddy Inducer		Makes an area hard to pass through, breaks formation, damages stuff
Cloaking Device		Now you see me...
Defense Field		Like HW; fleet-wide defense shield, doesn't stack much
Rock Camoflague		You look like a rock until you move ***Uhhhhh... O... kay...

DRIVES
Retrorockets --> Ion Drives (retrorockets aren't practical for long distance travel)
Nuclear --> Plasma Drives (Ion Drives +, basically) are logical next step
Sublight --> Sublight is such a cool name, but Nuclear is the next step after plasma
Fusion --> Fusion Drives logically follow nuclear drives, oddly enough
Impulse --> Traction Drives
Ion --> Impeller Drives (improved gravity engine)
Antimatter --> Sublight Drives (puts you near light speed, therefore sublight)
Interphased --> Inertialess Drive? I dunno.

ARMOR:

BATTLE
Defenders place their fleets wherever they want, and they know where the attacker's coming from.


PROBLEMS
AOE weapons.  Fleets can overlap, y'see, and friendly fire might be involved.
