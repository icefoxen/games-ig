IMMEDIATE
Fix sliders



VISUAL
Make better star sprites (animations might be tricky...) and display names of
colonies.

Fix various wxPython sizing and spacing issues...  buttons along bottom of
screen, for instance.  Labels in the sidebar panels, too.  Some nice bevelled
boxes around 'em and such would be nice too.
look at sizertest.py #24

Figure out how to get rid of the wxNotebook in MainScreen class, and just show
and hide the panels.  Apply that to the fleet and star panels, and the colony
panel in the star panel.
wxChoicebook might be what you're looking for.  Check the wxWidgets docs, not
wxPython.

I should have a few different sprites for fleets on the starmap depending on
how large a fleet is.

Fleets and starnames and such should have different colors for diff. people...

Fix colony display in general; come up with some nice final form.


CONCEPTUAL
How should fleets work?  Attached to carriers....

Production queues, tech trees, diplomacy, empires, colonies, races, combat

Tech draws related to each other?


FUNCTIONAL
Multiple fleets in orbit of a star!!!
Fleet production!
Make star mineral richness more of a bell-curve.
I'm going to need a SE4-ish news-notification system, probably.

Multiplayer!  Hmmmm....  You may just send in your Empire objects for turn
gen?  That might work.

Make better random-name list for star names
